## Functionalities

- The app uses the sensor input values of your phone to determine where to find animals.
- The radar display shows the relative direction and distance of the animal from the user’s current location, and also the physical context, e.g. temperature. 
- When an animal is found, the app could upload the data to Esri feature layers using the Android ArcGIS SDK.
- The app could visualize animal habitat map.
- Augmented Reality (AR) is integrated to allow users to place the animals (that you found using the app) in the real world.
- Good user experience.
